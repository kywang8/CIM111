  Creative Brief:
	I am my own client for this website, which will be used as a personal portfolio, and may one day serve as a platform for a sports reporting blog and/or shopping site. The site will help me along my career path as a way to sell myself as a professional to potential employers, and collate my work into one simple and easily-accessible place. The site’s only weaknesses will be my own. Since I am working in the journalism industry, I referenced several different publications’ websites when researching how to build my portfolio. The goal of this project is to create a portfolio that is easily accessible to employers, as well as dynamic and responsive. It should be professional and clean-cut, and clearly deliver information on myself and my work, especially since its’ main audience will be potential employers. Since these people will likely be looking at my portfolio online only in this format, I cannot rely on my in-person communication skills. I will try to incorporate my stylistic voice into the site through both visuals and words. The idea is to impress employers with my ability to work in multiple different media. By creating my very own website, I anticipate I will already be setting myself apart from the usual stack of applicants. My competition will be other potential job candidates, so I must differentiate myself from them in good, creative ways. I have to showcase my various talents clearly and show my work, rather than telling them about it in a typical resume. I will communicate in a professional way—not quite conversational, but still engaging. With this site I will be telling my future employer that I am a good hire; that I am smart, able, creative, inventive, experienced, and hard-working. For the most part, I will be letting my work do the talking, but intend to use sparse explanatory paragraphs to preface my articles/videos. My gallery visuals will be my own, but the visuals I will use as thumbnails for my articles will be screenshots from the pieces. I will also include friendly and professional photos to give an idea of how I am as both a person and as a job candidate. Eventually, I would like to add a shopping area, where I can showcase the Etsy shop I use to sell sports-related home goods. I would also like to continue working on my blog, and link various social media in. In the future, I will use different plug-ins, as well, to showcase my talents better. The only foreseeable expense will be the acquisition of a website domain. I will be reporting to myself for this project, which means I must be doing my best work in order to satisfy my own expectations.

  Write-Up:
  For my marketing campaign I will be advertising myself as a freelance sports journalist and broadcaster. I will be trying to attract employers using keywords like "journalist," "sports," and "broadcasting." I will be using this campaign for as many months as it takes to find a job, and will try to spend less than $200 a month. Consult images folder for the steps I took in creating my Google AdWords ad.
