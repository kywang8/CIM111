          <p>As the starting Quarterback (QB) for the Miami Dolphins, Ryan Tannehill has racked up an impressive resume, starting with his college career at Texas A&M, where he originally played Wide Reciever (WR).

            <section id="grid4"><h2> Professional Career </h2>
            <p>After finalizing his rookie contract in 2012, Tannehill was pronounced the starter for that season. His first game as a Dolphin ended in a disappointing 30-10 loss versus the Houston Texans. Tannehill's performance remained spotty throughout the season, but he managed to break Dolphins rookie records for most passing completions, passing attempts, and passing yards. He also had the longest rush of a Dolphins rookie QB. However, the Dolphins ended the season wth a mediocre 7-9 record.<br>
            These types of performances became commonplace for Tannehill, who alternated between high and low levels of play seemingly with no rhyme or reason. His second and third seasons were similar, ending in two consecutive 8-8 records for the Dolphins. <br>
            In 2015, despite general criticism from fans, Tannehill signed a 6-year, $96M contract. Even with better play from the QB, the Dolphins ended 6-10. In a victory over the Houston Texans that season, Tannehill became the 64th QB in NFL history to post a perfect 158.3 passer rating, as well as completing an NFL record 25 consecutive passes. HC Joe Philbin was fired four games into the season after starting with a 1-3 record. His interim replacement was tight ends coach Dan Campbell, who started promisingly with a 2-0 record, but ultimately ended 5-7. <br>
            In 2016, Adam Gase was hired and the coaching staff underwent major changes, including letting go of OC Bill Lazor. That season saw major improvement from Tannehill, who was allowed more leeway to audible and act as both QB and game manager. After a disappointing 1-4 start, the Dolphins rallied and won the next 6 games straight. They clinched a winning record for the first time since 2008, and also made the playoffs. Unfortunately, Tannehill went down in Week 14 with a knee injury, and his dreams of a playoff trip were cut short. Matt Moore started against the Pittsburgh Steelers in that Wildcard round, which ended in a 12-30 loss. The same ACL injury kept Tannehill out for the entire 2017 season. <br>
            Under Gase, Tannehill has improved immensely, showing better leadership skills and athletic abilities. His incredibly accurate deep balls were a pleasant surprise for Fins' fans, and the young WR core he throws to continues to show promise.

        <div><h2> Injuries </h2>
        <p>Prior to the 2016-17 season, Tannehill had never missed a game despite consistently recording high numbers of sacks. In Week 14 of last year, Arizona Cardinals defensive end Calais Campbell collided with Tannehill's leg, injuring his knee. Initially, there was concern that his ACL was torn, but further testing revealed that the QB had only sprained his ACL and MCL. He did not require surgery, and according to the Miami Herald on February 23rd, Tannehill’s knee was “pronounced healed by team doctor John Uribe and with a concurring second opinion of respected surgeon Dr. James Andrews." Tannehill was a full participant in all offseason activities leading up to the 2017-18 season, although he had been wearing a knee brace as a precaution. In pre-season, he tweaked the injury again and it was decided he should rest for the season instead of chancing further injury. Therefore, he did not play at all in the 2017-2018 season. </p>
